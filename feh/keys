# Comments start with a # sign, do not use them mid-line.
# Each line must be blank, a comment, or a key definition.
#
# key definition: <action name> <key1> [<key2> [<key3>]]

# Each <key> is an X11 keysym (as output by xev) with optional modifier.
# For instance, C-x would be Ctrl+X, or 4-space Mod4+Space

# Examples for vim-like menu bindings on a qwerty keyboard:
menu_parent h Left
menu_child  i Right
menu_down   n Down
menu_up     e Up
menu_select space Return

# Same for image navigation ...
next_img N N Right space
prev_img E H Left BackSpace

# and image movement
scroll_up    e
scroll_down  n
scroll_left  h
scroll_right i

# File deletion
#remove     d   Delete
#delete   C-d C-Delete

# remove now conflicts with toggle_filenames, so change that
toggle_filenames f

# zooming
zoom_in  C-e
zoom_out C-n
zoom_default a
zoom_fit s

# I only hit these accidentaly
save_image
save_filelist

# This leaves some conflicts with existing default bindings, but you should
# get the idea.  And I'm not gonna fix the conflicts, I don't use qwerty ;-)
